# Password Generator

## Description

I was tasked with creating the JavaScript code to enable a password generator to create a password using criteria entered by the user. This project allowed me to step into the world of JavaScript and understand further the relationships between functions, variables, loops, logical comparisons, etc. The initial problem provided was a non-functioning GUI that, after completion, works as requested. The final product provides a clean and polished, intuitive interface that is simple to operate.

My biggest challenge to start was learning how to pseudocode the inital acceptance criteria properly. I learned this primarily involves breaking down previous versions of my pseudocode further until the actual coded steps become clearer and I have a working step or model. I also learned to check my functionality often so I do not find myself halfway through the project with a code that doesn't work and no idea where to begin debugging!

## Usage

- Upon the browser page loading completely, the user will click the 'Generate Password' button.

- They will be prompted to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters.

- Once an acceptable number is provided, the user is asked to select which type of characters they would like to include in the generated password.
